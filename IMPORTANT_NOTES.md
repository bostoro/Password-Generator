# ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

## 🔐 Master Password is Now HIDDEN

When you enter the master password (option 3), **you won't see what you type** - this is for security!

```
🔒 Enter master password: [nothing shown while typing]
```

**This is NORMAL and SECURE!**

Just type `123456` and press Enter, even though you can't see it.

## 📧 Email/Username Saving

Your emails ARE being saved correctly!

### Why you see "test@email.com" sometimes:

When you run `python3 datastore.py` directly, it runs **automated tests** that add a test entry with:
- Username: `test@email.com`
- Platform: `https://test.com`
- Password: `MySuperPassword123!`

This is just for testing the database functions.

### Your real data:

When you use the main program (`python3 main.py`), **all your data is saved correctly**:
- Option 1 (Generate password) → Saves YOUR username and website
- Option 2 (Save manually) → Saves YOUR username and website

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Save a custom password
```bash
python3 main.py
# Choose option 2
# Username: YOUR_EMAIL@example.com
# Website: https://yoursite.com
# Password: YourPassword
```

### Test 2: View your saved passwords
```bash
python3 main.py
# Choose option 3
# Type: 123456 (you won't see it - this is normal!)
# Press Enter
# You'll see YOUR email saved correctly
```

## ✅ Everything Works Correctly!

- ✅ Master password is **hidden** (secure)
- ✅ Your emails/usernames are **saved correctly**
- ✅ Passwords are **encrypted** in database
- ✅ You can **view** them with master password

---

## 💡 Quick Reminder

**Master Password:** `123456`

**Change it:** Edit `datastore.py` line 26
```python
MASTER_PASSWORD = "123456"  # ← Change this to your own
```

**Everything is working as intended!** 🎉
