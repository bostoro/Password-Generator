# Password Manager - Generate & Check passwords (Console)

**Problem**
Passwords need to be dealed with locally to ensure best security practices.

**Scenario**

The password generator solves the part of the problem where the user is dependant on third party password generators. The user is in need of localy generated passwords. Complementary to the existing gpassword manager a passworrd generator is needed.


**User stories:**
1. As a user, I want to see the lsit of commands.
2. As a user, I want to select generation options of the password.
3. As a user, I want see the history of the generated passwords.
4. As a user, I want to get feedback on the passwords strength.

**Use cases:**
- Show possible commands
- Generate password (possible options)
- Show password's strength
- Encrypt and decrypt passwords
- Access User and Password information (from `passwords.db`)
- Managing passwords

## ✅ Project Requirements

Each app must meet the following three criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Interactive app (console input)
2. Data validation (input checking)
3. File processing (read/write)

---

### 1. Interactive App (Console Input)

---
The application interacts with the user via the console. Users can:
- View the possible commands
- Generate passwords
- Manage users and  passwords
- Receive a feedback on the stength of the passwords

---


### 2. Data Validation

The application validates all user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience. This is implemented in `main-invoice.py` as follows:

- **Generate password (possible options):** When the user wants to create a password, the program checks if the input is a digit and within the valid menu range:
	```python
	if not choice.isdigit() or not (1 <= int(choice) <= len(menu)):
			print("⚠️ Invalid choice.")
			continue
	```
	This ensures only valid menu items can be generated.

- **Pasword storage validation:** When reading the stored passwords file, the program checks for valid entries in the database and skips invalid lines:
	```python
	try:
			menu.append({"name": name, "size": size, "price": float(price)})
	except ValueError:
			print(f"⚠️ Skipping invalid line: {line.strip()}")
	```

- **Password management options:** The management menu checks for valid options and handles invalid choices gracefully:
	```python
	else:
			print("⚠️ Invalid choice.")
	```

These checks prevent crashes and guide the user to provide correct input, matching the validation requirements described in the project guidelines.

### 3. File Processing

The application reads and writes data using files:

- **Input file:** `menu.txt` — Contains the pizza menu, one item per line in the format `PizzaName;Size;Price`.
	- Example:
		```
		Margherita;Medium;12.50
		Salami;Large;15.00
		Funghi;Small;9.00
		```
	- The application reads this file at startup to display available pizzas.

- **Output file:** `invoice_001.txt` (and similar) — Generated when an order is completed. Contains a summary of the order, including items, quantities, prices, discounts, and totals.
	- Example:
		```
		Invoice #001
		----------------------
		1x Margherita (Medium)   12.50


		2x Salami (Large)        30.00
		----------------------
		Total:                  42.50
		Discount:                2.50
		Amount Due:             40.00
		```
		- The output file serves as a record for both the user and the pizzeria, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

## ⚙️ Implementation

### Technology
- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- No external libraries

### 📂 Repository Structure
```text
PizzaRP/
├── main.py             # main program logic (console application)
├── menu.txt            # pizza menu (input data file)
├── invoice_001.txt     # example of a generated invoice (output file)
├── docs/               # optional screenshots or project documentation
└── README.md           # project description and milestones
```

### How to Run
> 🚧 Adjust if needed.
1. Open the repository in **GitHub Codespaces**
2. Open the **Terminal**
3. Run:
	```bash
	python3 main.py
	```

### Libraries Used

- `os`: Used for file and path operations, such as checking if the menu file exists and creating new files.
- `glob`: Used to find all invoice files matching a pattern (e.g., `invoice_*.txt`) to determine the next invoice number.

These libraries are part of the Python standard library, so no external installation is required. They were chosen for their simplicity and effectiveness in handling file management tasks in a console application.
